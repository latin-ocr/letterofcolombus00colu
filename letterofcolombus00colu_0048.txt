most fortunate kingdoms, and all other countries of
Christendom give thanks to our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, who has bestowed upon us so great a

covered with festive garlands. Let Christ rejoice on
earth, as he rejoices in heaven, when he foresees com-

tion of our saith, as on account of the increase of our
temporal affairs, of which not only Spain, but universal
Christendom will be partaker. These things that have
been done are thus briefly related. Farewell. Lisbon,
the day before the ides of March.1
