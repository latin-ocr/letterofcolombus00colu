Epigram of R. L. de Corbaria, bishop of Monte
Peloso.

To the most invincible King of Spain.

No region now can add to Spain’s great deeds:
To such men all the world is yet too small.
An Orient land, found far beyond the waves,
Will add, great Betim, to thy renown.
Then to Columbus‚ the true finder, give
Due thanks 3 but greater still to God on high 3
Who makes new kingdoms for himself and thee:
Both firm and pious let thy conduct be.
