Bartholomew Kiistler, in 1497, in seven leaves. There
is a copy in the Lenox Library.

Resides the printed editions mentioned above, there
are extant several manuscript copies in Spanish. One
in the Archives of Simancas, addressed to the “Escri-
bano de Racion,’' was printed by N avarrete in his
Coleccz'on de Vc'ages (Madrid, 1825), Vol. Ι, pp. 167-175.
It is also described, and an English synopsis given, by
G. A. Bergenroth, in the Calemlar of Letters, Despalclzes,
and State Papers, relczting to tlte Negotiations between
England and Spain (London, 1862), Vol. I, pp. 43—48.
Another manuscript, in Spanish, addressed to Don
Gabriel Sanchez, was discovered by Varnhagen in the
Colegio Mayor at Cuenca, and published by him at
Valencia in 1858. Columbus also made a full report
of his voyage in the form of a diary, which he sent to
the Spanish sovereigns. The original of this has not
been found, but an abridgment‚ or synopsis, made by
Bartolome de Las Casas, is extant, and has been printed
in Navarrete’s Coleccion. The transcript of this manu-
script which was probably used by Mufioz and N avar-
rete is now in the Lenox Library. An English trans-
lation of this “ Personal Narrative,'' made by Samuel
Kettell, was printed at Boston in 1827.
