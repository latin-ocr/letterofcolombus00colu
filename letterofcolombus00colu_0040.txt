in the month of May3 some of thern were blossoming,
some were bearing fruit, some were in other condi-
tions; each one was thriving in its own way. The
nightingale and various other birds without number
were singing, in the month of November, when I was
exploring them. There are besides in the said island
Juana seven or eight kinds of palm trees, which far
excel ours in height and beauty‚ just as all the other
trees, herbs, and fruits do. There are also excellent
pine trees, vast plains and meadows, a variety of birds,
a variety of honey, and a variety of metals, excepting
iron. In the one which was called Hispana, as we
said above, there are great and beautiful mountains,
vast fields, groves, fertile plains, very suitable for
vplanting and cultivating, and for the building of houses.
The convenience of the harbors in this island, and the
remarkable number of rivers contributing to the health-
fulness of man, exceed belief, unless one has seen them.
The trees, pasturage, and fruits of this island differ
greatly from those of Juana. This Hispana, moreover,
abounds in different kinds of spices, in gold, and in
metals. On this island, indeed, and on all the others
which I have seen, and of which Ι have knowledge,
the inhabitants of both sexes go always naked, just as
they came into the world, except some of the women,
who use a covering of a leaf or some foliage, or a
cotton cloth, which they make themselves for that pur-
pose. All these people lack, as I said above, every
k'ind of iron, they are also without weapons, which
indeed are unknown ; nor are they competent to use
