on the land, and it was my intention to go to the south,
moreover the winds were becoming violent, Ι therefore
determined that no other plans were practicable, and
SO, going back, Ι returned to a certain bay that I had
noticed, from which Ι sent two of our men to the land,
that they might find out whether there was a king in
this country, or any cities. These men traveled for
three days, and they found people and houses without
number, but they were small and without any govern-
ment, therefore they returned. Now in the meantime
Ι had learned from certain Indians, whorn I had
seized there, that this country was indeed an island,
and therefore Ι proceeded towards the east, keeping
all the time near the coast, for 322 miles, to the ex-
treme ends of this island. From this place Ι saw
another island to the east, distant from this Juana
54 miles, which I called forthwith Hispana31 and I
sailed to it ς and Ι steered along the northern coast, as
at Juana, towards the east, 564 miles. And the said
Juana and the other islands there appear very fertile.
This island is surrounded by many very safe and wide
harbors, not excelled by any others that Ι have ever
seen. Many great and salubrious rivers flow through
it. There are also many very high mountains there.
All these islands are very beautiful, and distinguished
by various qualities 3 they are accessible, and full of a
great variety of trees stretching up to the stars; the
leaves of which I believe are never shed, for Ι saw them
as green and flourishing as they are usually in Spain
