straight hair, hanging down. They do not remain
where the solar rays send out the heat‚ for the strength
of the sun is very great here, because it is distant from
the equinoctial line, as it seems, only twenty-six de-
grees. On the tops of the mountains too the cold is
severe, but the Indians, however, moderate it, partly
by being accustomed to the place, and partly by the
help of very hot victuals‚ of which they eat frequently
and immoderately. And so I did not see any mon-
strosity, nor did I have knowledge of thern any where,
excepting a certain island named Charis,1 which is the
second in passing from Hispana to India. This island
is inhabited by a certain people who are considered
very warlike by their neighbors. These eat hurnan
flesh. The said people have many kinds of row-boats‚
in which they cross over to all the other Indian is-
lands, and seize and carry away every thing that they
can. They differ in no way from the others, only that
they wear long hair like the women. They use bows
and darts made of reeds, with sharpened shafts fas-
tened to the larger end, as we have described. On
this account they are considered warlike, wherefore the
other Indians are afflicted with continual sear, but I
regard thern as of no more account than the others.
These are the people who visit certain women, who
alone inhabit the island Mateunin,·2 which is the first
in passing from Hispana to India. These women,
moreover, perform no kind of work of their sex, for
they use bows and darts, like those I have described
